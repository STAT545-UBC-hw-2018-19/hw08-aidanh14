# Homework 08 - BCL Shiny App

My modified version of the basic BCL app is deployed online here: https://aidanh14.shinyapps.io/bclapp/

We were tasked with adding 3 features to the basic app. Here are my additional features:

- *DT interactive table*: Search results render as an interactive table from using the DT library to further search and filter results.

- *BC Liquor Stores Logo*: An image file of the BC Liquor Stores' logo is rendered in the sidebar panel.

- *Choice between histogram or density plot*: A radio button widget has been added for the user to dynamically switch between plotting alcohol content of search results as either a histogram (as in the basic app) or a denisty plot.
